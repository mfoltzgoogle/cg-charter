      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/">Second Screen
      Community Group (CG)</a> explores the use of secondary screens from Web
      pages. We propose that this Community Group incubate and develop
      specifications of network protocols that implement the
      <a href="https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation API</a> and the
      <a href="https://w3c.github.io/remote-playback/">Remote Playback API</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work has three primary purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Enable interoperability among implementations of the Presentation
        API.</em> All browsers and displays that implement the
        specifications should be able to act as <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#dfn-controlling-user-agent">controlling
        user agents</a> or <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/#dfn-receiving-user-agent">receiving
        user agents</a> for the Presentation API, with strong security and
        authentication for the data exchanged among them. Interoperability among
        controllers and receivers will increase the number of opportunities for
        the Presentation API to be useful. Interoperability will also create more
        uniform and predictable API behavior across user agents, encouraging
        adoption of the Presentation API by Web developers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Encourage implementation of the Presentation API by browser
        vendors.</em> The specifications should reduce the design work
        required to implement the Presentation API in a user agent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Establish complementary specifications for the Presentation
        API.</em> The Presentation API, by nature of its scope, leaves many
        network details up to the implementation. This includes how presentation
        displays are discovered, how presentations are started, connected, and
        stopped, and how the controller and receiver communicate. The
        specifications will provide details on how the implementation
        requirements of the Presentation API can be met and will clarify
        implementation issues that are not addressed in the Presentation API
        specification itself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The scope of work proposed here goes beyond the current <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/charter.html#scope">scope</a> of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">Second Screen Working
      Group (WG)</a>. Given wider support and adequate stability, we plan to
      migrate the proposals generated in this Community Group to an appropriate
      standards track, for example the <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026#section-4">IETF Standards Track</a>
      or a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Working">W3C
      Working Group</a>, for further contributions and formal standardization.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      The process, structure, format and patent policies of prospective
      standards bodies should be discussed before committing to a particular
      standards track for this work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Membership of the group is open to everybody. Upon joining the group,
      participants agree to the terms of the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="background">
      Background
    </h2>
    <p>
      Under the <a href=
      "https://github.com/webscreens/presentation-api/wiki/Second-Screen-Community-Group-Charter">
      previous charter</a>, the Second Screen Community Group (CG) delivered
      the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/presentation-api/20141118/">Presentation
      API Community Group Final Report</a> Specification that provides an API
      for a Web page to display and control content on a secondary screen. The
      work was migrated to the W3C Second Screen Working Group (WG) and the
      Community Group Final Report was provided as input to the <a href=
      "https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation API</a> that is
      now being developed in the WG.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Presentation API allows web applications to use secondary screens to
      display Web content. The initiating HTML page can request display of an
      HTML page on the second screen with a messaging channel between the two
      pages to enable communication and control. The two pages can both be
      rendered on the controlling user agent with just the video display sent
      to the second device ("1-UA mode"), or the second page can be rendered
      independently on the receiving user agent ("2-UA mode").
    </p>
    <p>
      The Presentation API abstracts away the means of connecting as well as
      the underlying communication and video streaming technologies.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following tasks are in scope for the work of the community group.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The specification of a set of network protocols that allows one user
        agent to use the Presentation API to discover and present Web content on
        another user agent, when both user agents are connected to the same Local
        Area Network (LAN).
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocols that implement all of the interfaces, attributes, methods,
        algorithms, and implementation requirements of the Presentation API are in
        scope. This includes protocols that preserve the privacy and security of
        data exchanged between the controlling and receiving user agents.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 2-UA mode of the Presentation API is in scope, so the focus will
        be on establishing presentations on a distinct receiving user agent. In
        2-UA mode, the receiving user agent renders the presented document
        independently and messages between documents are exchanged via the
        network.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocols that implement all of the interfaces, attributes, methods,
        algorithms, and implementation requirements of the Remote Playback API
        are also in scope, for the specific case of remotely playing
        a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element with a <code>src</code>
        or <code>source</code>s URL media source on a presentation display.  (In
        the Remote Playback API, this is referred to as the "media flinging"
        case.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Extension points for protocols developed are in scope, to make it
        possible to add new features via future specifications produced outside
        of this community group. For example, features such as 1-UA mode that
        are out of scope for this community group may be supported through
        future protocol extensions.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Where possible, the group will use established normative standards as a
      basis for specifications to reduce the scope of work.  For example, local
      area discovery could be implemented
      via <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762">Multicast DNS</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      For this community group, the following tasks are out of scope.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Additions to the APIs defined in the Second Screen WG are out of scope
        other than what is necessary to implement those APIs by remoting
        requests to the second user agent.  Defining media codecs or new
        specifications for transmitting media codecs is out of scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocols that implement 1-UA mode for the Presentation API are not
        in scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocols that implement the Remote Playback API for HTML media that
        uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/">Media Source
        Extensions</a>
        or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/">Encrypted Media
        Extensions</a> are not in scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protocols that support use of presentation displays connected by
        technologies other than IPv4/IPv6 local area networks are not in scope.
        Protocols that allow interaction between controlling and receiving user
        agents on different local area networks (i.e., firewall
        or NAT traversal) are not in scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developing specifications for use of the Presentation API with
        proprietary presentation display network protocols such as DIAL, DLNA,
        Google Cast, MiraCast, or Airplay are not in scope.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="deliverables">
      Deliverables
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>The group will only produce Specifications listed in this
      section</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Community Group will deliver specifications designed to meet
      the <a href="requirements.md">functional and security requirements</a> of
      the Presentation API and the Remote Playback API.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A specification for controlling and receiving user agents that describes
        how the controlling user agent will find available presentation displays
        on the local area network and establish two-way communication with one
        of them.  It also describes how the controlling user agent will
        authenticate the receiving user agent and establish a confidential
        communication channel.
      </li>
      <li>
        A specification for controlling and receiving user agents that
        describes how a controlling user agent may start, connect, stop and
        exchange messages with a presentation on a receiving user agent via
        the Presentation API.
      </li>
      <li>
        A specification for controlling and receiving user agents that describes
        how a controlling user agent may start and control remote playback via
        the Remote Playback API.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To add any additional specifications, this Charter must be amended by the
      process described in the <a href="#charter-change">Amendments to the
      Charter</a> section. All deliverables for which the CLA <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/#id3">Patents</a>
      section applies must be designated as such here.

    <p>
      The group may produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of
      this charter but that are not Specifications, for instance use cases,
      requirements, or white papers.
    </p>
    <h2 id="liaisons">
      Dependencies or Liaisons
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is anticipated that the group will collaborate with appropriate W3C
      Working Groups in order to transition specification proposals to the
      Recommendation Track.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This group works closely with the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/2014/secondscreen/">W3C Second Screen Working
      Group</a>.
      </li>
      <li>There are no external specifications that must be created before the
      Specification(s) to be developed in this group can be completed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. Proposals in this Community
      Group charter are applicable "Specification" in the CLA. When people
      request to participate without representing their organization's legal
      interests, W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with
      the following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a>. The

      the form of a pull request (preferred), by raising an issue, or by adding
      a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created for proposals in the Community Group must use the

    </p>
    <p>
      Note: this Community Group will not use a <em>contrib</em> mailing list
      for contributions since all contributions will be tracked via Github
      mechanisms (e.g. pull requests).
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using RFC 2777).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. The
      Editor(s) of a specification will determine and record consensus
      decisions through the specification's GitHub repo issue list with
      assistance from the Community Group Chair(s). Members of the group may
      reopen issues with new technical information.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the Community Group, and does not
      unreasonably favour or discriminate against any group participant or
      their employer. With that said, the group favours forward motion and
      dissent will not be allowed to block work on a specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and there
      is a call for assessing consensus after due consideration of different
      opinions, the Chair should record a decision and any objections.
      Participants may call for an online vote if they feel the Chair has not
      accurately determined the consensus of the group or if the Chair refuses
      to assess consensus. The call for a vote must specify the duration of the
      vote which must be at least 7 days and should be no more than 14 days.
      The Chair must start the vote within 7 days of the request. The decision
      will be based on the majority of the ballots cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, the Editor(s) and Chair(s) are the only Committers. It is
      expected that participants can earn Committer status in a GitHub
      reposiroty through a history of valuable contributions as is common in
      open source projects.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work on its GitHub
      repositories (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure
      contributions can be tracked and to ensure that engagement will scale to
      a large number of proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in the repository issues list. Any group participant may object to a
      decision reached at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of
      publication of the decision provided that they include clear technical
      reasons for their objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try
      to resolve the objection according to the <a href="#decision">Decision
      Process</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
